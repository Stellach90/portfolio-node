        <h4>Self portrait : three figures</h4>
        <p>An evocative night at 11 P.M. I drew my face and the ideal of what I dreamed
            of. I drew lights of various thoughts in the shape to different colors and
            patterns around my face at 11 p.m. The different patterns of light bulbs
            shape the different ideas I think.</p>

I have shaped the optic nerve into a regular buttons and a buttons made of soft clay, and shaped the shape of my memory at each end.</p>

        <h4>Self portrait : Emotion</h4>
        <p>What are the shapes that I feel? I have characterized my mood swings. Especially the kind of feeling that is exhaling from the straw at the front showed pleasure. Then the orange ball showed excitement. The shift-and- forward patterns were designed and shaped. Other lumps of blue can symbolize a feeling of calm, a lack of imagination for pink, a sense of apprehension for yellow, and a feeling of melancholy for green. After various experimented with frame, plastic containers, acrylic paints, straws, urethane foam to visualize feelings, then I developed it using the above material. Then installed my feelings and put them into space.</p>
